upload zip file containing two csv files.

files are named.



database requests.


Should there be a separate csv thing? or should I have a database type option? For csv data / file data? That probably makes the most sense.



Ok here's the issue. There will be times when I want to save the csv file as a file, and there will be times when I want to save the values in the csv file as documents.

Can there be csv data and files in the same
- dataset? no
- project? yes



FILE DATASET
- add files from zip archive

TABLE DATASET
- load new columns from csv (must have same number of rows as existing table)
- load new rows from csv (must have same columns as existing table)
- should usually just upload a single big csv file
